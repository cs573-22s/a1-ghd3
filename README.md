For assignment 1, I thought it best to use this as an opportunity for me to introduce myself. So, I tried to give a glimpse into some of my personal interests as well as some more professional ones. 


I start by discussing how my hobbies tend towards gaming and music. I even highlight some of my favorite pieces of media in each area, focusing on my love for Critical Role, Final Fantasy, and the best up and coming musical artist right now (imo)-- Ashnikko. From a more technical standpoint, I followed a formula of red buttons (becasue who doesn't love to push red buttons) which when clicked reveal a creation which was mad with methods in d3. While these are realistically very simplistic in the grand scheme of things or even the visualizations made in this class, I tried to familiarize myself with the basics of d3 and focused more on expressing myself because this was my first foray into html in general. Learning curve aside, I was able to create represetations of the Vox Machina logo and the playstation symbols. For those of you who may not know, Vox Machina is the name of the adventuring party who were the main charcaters of Critical Role's first ever campaign, and are even getting a brand new adult animated series on Amazon Prime next Friday, so you should definitely check it out.

Moving on to my professional life, I talk breifly about my experience in the BCB department here. Then I move into some research experiences I've had that really highlight my interest in appling ML techniques to solve problems within and outside of the domain of Biology. And I end by touching on my previous summer intern experience where I got to make a real impact in cancer research-- leading the investigation efforts into a dataset related to prostate cancer gene expression which lead to many exciting new insights and potential vulnerabilities in that type of tumor. Technically, I followed the same pattern of button and drawing as I did above. However, this time I chose to create a chromosome as a representation of not only my interest in biology, but that most of my work has revolved around DNA and the resulting gene expression patterns we see in cells.

Finally, I ended out with a cute representation of a smiley face and thanked you for getting to know me.
