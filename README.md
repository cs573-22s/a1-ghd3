### Technical Achievement Description:

I started this project by drawing one circle, one rectangle, and one triangle made with path. I also make two buttons on the top of the page, each button will change the location of items. For aesthetic reasons, hovering on the circle or rectangle will change the color of the shapes to different color palettes.
  
  
### Design Achievement Description:

Because of my personal graphic design experience, the color palette and combination have been carefully chosen to achieve a harmonic and peaceful mood.
