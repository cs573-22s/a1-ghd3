**What I Created**

I wanted to do something interactive, like a little story. I chose to base it on the Legend of Zelda videogames, since I really like them. When we load the page first, we start with a starting view: A quick introduction, the triforce missing, Link and Zelda in front of each other, and a book at the bottom with an instruction to hit it.

Once the user clicks on the book, the instruction to hit it disappears, and a few things happen. A path to the correct pillar to hit appears, along with text saying to hit the pillar. The pillar also changes color, and goes from yellow to blue to further separate it from the others.

Finally, once the user clicks on the correct pillar, the text saying to hit it disappears. A triforce also appears a little more slowly on top of all the pillars, and a final piece of text appears to let the player know they got the Triforce.

**Technical Achievement**

This was my first time making anything with html, so it was definitely a challenge to learn all the notations and the way the language worked. I'm still a little lost when D3 just infers things from my code, I'm not used to things not being explicit.
Even then, I think I did pretty good. I used all the required objects (circles to make pillars, rectangles to make characters and different items, lines for the triforce, and paths for the blue path) and even used text objects to add directions for the user. I played with the colors of the text to make it appear when needed, and linked multiple things to different events to coordinate what happened on the screen based on user actions. I added some animation for the triforce's appearance as well. 
I think what took me most time was learning how to correctly select things in different situations, find the functions I needed to build specific things, and the order in which to create items to have everything come together the way I wanted, but I'd say it was worth it. 

**Design Achievement**

I think that I did pretty well design wise. I wanted to include things that really reminded the user of the Zelda games, to make it even clearer where I drew inspiration from. The triforce has the right shape, and I went for a very minimalistic design for Link and Zelda, while still keeping them recognizable (At least for people familiar with the characters). I think they look pretty good!
I also did design a story for this assignment, because I felt it made it more interesting to look at and interact with. It is fairly short and simple, but I'd argue it still has merit. I also tried to add a little humor with the book title, so hopefully people appreciate that too.

Overall, I'm pleased with the way this assignment came together. I still have a lot more to learn, but for a first shot at html and D3 I'm proud of what I did!
