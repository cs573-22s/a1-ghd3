For this assignment, I created a variety of shapes across an svg file. This assignment reminded me of a wooden children's toy, where the child must locate the differently shaped openings in a wooden cube and try to place wooden blocks that fit into thier corresponding opening. I placed different shapes all around the svg to recreate that image.

Technical Acievement 
---
The technical aspect of this assingment includes several shapes changing colors or moving across the screen. For example, clicking on the green rectangle will result in it turning magenta, clicking on the red circle will cause it to move down the page, and clicking on the teal triangle will result in its outline turning a red color. Using the code in the sources found above, I was able to change things up to make them fit on the svg where I wanted them to be and change the direction that the line was facing. 

Design Achievement
---
For the design aspect of this assignment, I went with a very simple color scheme, using mostly basic colors. There was a variety of colors chosen for each of the elements. As this was my first time working with d3.js, the design is very simple.
