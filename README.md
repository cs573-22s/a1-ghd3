Technical Achievement Desription
---

For the technical achievement part, in addition to the most basic creation of circles, rectangles, lines and paths using d3, further interactive effects have been added.  
The results of this assignment can be divided into three main parts.  
- Simple circles, rectangles, lines and paths in different colors

- Color change and rolling circle animation effect
1. The color bound to the circles is changed by the scrolling of the rgb.
2. When keep mouse over a circle, it will roll to right; when click on a circle, it will roll back. A little interesting thing achieved with 'mouseover' and 'click'. 
3. The opacity changes in an order make it more ornamental.

- A little eliminating game using simple d3 and svg knowledge
1. The combination with timer gives it a certain interest and can fully display the interaction.
2. Use a combination of timer and d3 to change the attributes of the circles at certain time to achieve the effect.
3. Clever use of ‘mouseover’ to achieve the effect of a small elimination game.


Design Achievement Description
---

For the design achievement part, I found the following interesting design points:
1. The application of the opacity property makes the effect look more beautiful and refined.
2. The combination of 'mouseover' and 'click' makes the interaction interesting and can be a more complex looking interaction.
3. Presenting the interaction through a mini-game is a very interesting experience for me, and the task is much more fun and meaningful.
