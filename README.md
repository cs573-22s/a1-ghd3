## Inspiration & Motivation
I began my project by exploring online cool projects that utilize javascript and d3. I mainly came across projects from codepen that were coded mostly using javascript/css/html, but I gave them all a look so that I could begin generating ideas of what I wanted to accomplish for this assignment. Here are some links that I found cool and interesting and that motivated the concept behind my project.
- https://codepen.io/stephaniewalter/pen/xxVgReM ~ Day and Night Animation
- https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/jxPgKv ~ Indoors or Outdoors? 

I didn't use any of the above links for source code with the exception of using the image of the boy which was retrieved from the second link.

## ScreenShots

## Technical Achievements
- Animating the shapes so that they can transitions
- Creating functions for the on-click functionality of the buttons
- Being able to emulate night and day transitions

## Design Achievement
- Creating a radial gradient background to accentuate my sun/moon svg
- Being able to change the color of the shapes when a button gets pressed or on mouse click
- I was able to center my illustration of the boy and have the stars hover above the boy

## Additional Comments
- I considered this project a challenge and a huge learning curve. I am not well versed with javascript/css/d3 and the coding experiences I have had with them are very minimal. While I did struggle and did not achieve the vision I had for this project, I truly did enjoy putting the time and effort into this assignment. From the start, I enjoyed doing research on javascript and d3 projects. This challenge also led me to look up numerous tutorials on how to do certain things in javascript and d3 which added to my learning experience outside of class. I got really excited seeing the potential and amazing things one could accomplish when coding and using javascript/d3 to create unique and innovative visualizations. Moving forward, I do hope that I can have a better grasp at coding and working with javascript/d3 so that I can create cool and personalized visualizations.
