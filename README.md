Code Reference

Most of the ideas came from the professor's demo in the class, the other references are listed below:

Technical Achievements
---
- Click on the circles and they will change the color and then move from top left to bottom right. During its movement, its speed and size will change.
- Move the mouse to the outmost raectangle, it will change the color into deep green. And when you move the mouse away, it will return to the original light green.
- Press on the 'blue butterfly' (the polygon in deep blue), it will flap the wings and fly to the pink flower. During the movement, its color will change into red and its size will become smaller and smaller. When you stop pressing on it, it will fly back to its original position and the color and the size will return back to the original kind.
- Click on the button on the right of the blue WindMill, it will rotate. The more you click on the button, the fast the windmill will rotate.

Design Achievements
---
- There are instructions about how to interact with the figures in each part.
- Each part has a theme color in order to make the page coordination.
- In the second part, the rectangles are filled with gradient color to improve the visual effects.
- In the third part, the lines are designed to imitate the rainbow.
