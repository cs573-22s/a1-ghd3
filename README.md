This project is aimed to show how to draw different shapes and add some animations on top of it. Here I used circles, lines, and rectangles to form shapes with different colors. I also demonstrated how to use path to draw trapezoid.

Technical Achievement Description
---
1. Drawn different shapes of objects including circles, lines, rectangles and path in different colors. 
2. Drawn different shapes of objects on top of each other to form animations of separation and combination of objects.
3. Calculated and implemented a trapezoid path.


Design Achievement Description
---
1. Showed how to layer symmetric objects on top of each other, and how to view each object individually through animation.
2. Showed symmetrical paths that looked stable and pyrimidal.
3. Added index to help readers navigate the site.
