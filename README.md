Project description: 

- Element 1: Interactive bar graph
    - This is a simple bar graph that has interactability that adds information to the graph. If you hover over it, it emphasises the hovered element and displays the value of the element on top of it. This adds readability to the graph and makes it easier to compare the elements (hmmm...) while keeping it not as cluttered at a glance.

- Element 2: Interactive circle
    - This may seem like a normal circle, but that is far from the truth. If you hover over it, you will see that some text and a line seem to follow your movement, but not directly. The circle takes where your mouse is and projects it to its edge to place the text and line and rotate it accordingly. It also seems to have a bit of a personality. 
    
- Element 3: Infinity path
    - This is not interactive, but it was a cool animation. I research on how to animate paths and implemented it only to find it wasnt as satisfying as I wanted. I toyed around with the path itself to make it into a looping animation that at the very least satisfied me. 

Technical achievements:
1. Bar graph interactability and displaying of text in proper places
2. Circle text/line placement and projection (required a bunch of circle math)
3. Animating the path

Design achievements:
1. Bar graph visual clarity and interactive clarity (ie its clear what information is tied to what element)
2. The bar interaction takes into account the length of the data to present it properly (either length of two digits or one for now) 
3. Circle is interactive, smooth, and has a personality (I named it arccosine after the math that was required)
4. The path animation is able to loop, increasing satisfaction levels
