Technical Achievements:

For my technical achievement I made the shapes move a new location to resemble "falling" or "moving" when the user selected the shape. I also utilized different svg's to create circles, triangles and rectangles. I also used paths to create shapes like the two triangles that create rectangles as well. 


Design Achievements:

For my design achievement i made the shapes change color when they were clicked. This allowed for users to know that there was an interaction and that they should select it until they all moved. I used a path and wanted to create a box that was filled half black and half white to portray an interesting shape! Once you select each of the shapes five times, then the black shapes will drop and turn into the light pink and maroon shapes.
